        question: "What is Surprise Santa?",
        answer: "Surprise Santa is a Christmas tradition. It involves a group of people exchanging gifts with each other, but not knowing who is giving them a gift. This is done by randomly assigning each person in the group another person to give a gift to. This is done anonymously, so the person receiving the gift doesn't know who it is from. The person giving the gift doesn't know who they are giving a gift to either. This is why it is called Surprise Santa.",
